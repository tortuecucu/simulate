# Simulate, simple simulation system

Simulate uses ressources and people to produce items in work centers.
Data that define instances behaviours and relationship are wrapped into a dataset called Scenario.
Playing a Scenario is called a Simulation.

## Philosophy
Simulate provides a flexible framework for designing models that acts like a process in real world.
Classes are designed for easy customization for building a tailored solution.

## Simulation process
Simulating is a tool that serves an process improvement or design project. It is not a project by itself.
Simulating permets to better understand the current picture as well are defining the better ways to achieve the improvement objectives.
Simulating requires far more than just running code


1. Analyzing the current picture
2. Defining improvement target
3. Building a model that acts like the real world
4. Builing & running alternative scenarios
5. Analyzing & comparing results for validating improvement strategy
